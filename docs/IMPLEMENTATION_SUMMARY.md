# Signing Confirmation Screen - Implementation Summary

## Overview
A new signing confirmation screen has been added to PocketPay Mobile to separate the user's "approval to sign" from the actual transaction execution. This improves security awareness and provides users with a clear "last chance to cancel" moment.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New Screen Component
**File**: `app/sign-confirmation.tsx`

A full-screen signing confirmation interface that displays:
- **Warning banner**: Alerts users that signing is irreversible
- **Transaction summary card**: Shows all transaction details (from, to, amount, memo, fee, network)
- **Security information card**: Explains what happens during signing
- **Privacy notice**: Clarifies that technical details are hidden
- **Action buttons**: Cancel and Sign Transaction

**Key Features:**
- Contact name resolution for saved addresses
- Address truncation for better UX
- Loading states during navigation
- Cancel confirmation alert
- Error handling for missing parameters
- Theme-aware styling (light/dark mode)
- Full accessibility support

### 2. Updated Navigation Flow
**File**: `app/send.tsx`

Modified the `handleSend()` function to navigate to `/sign-confirmation` instead of directly to `/review-transaction`:

**Before:**
```
Send → Review Transaction → Payment Success
```

**After:**
```
Send → Sign Confirmation → Review Transaction → Payment Success
```

This creates a 3-stage payment process:
1. **Send**: User enters payment details
2. **Sign Confirmation**: User approves signing intent
3. **Review Transaction**: Actual signing and submission

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation
Created three documentation files:

#### a. `docs/signing-confirmation-flow.md`
- Flow architecture diagrams
- User experience goals
- Screen details and UI components
- Integration with existing signer handoff
- Security considerations
- Accessibility features
- Future enhancements
- Code references

#### b. `docs/testing/sign-confirmation-test-plan.md`
- 12 test categories covering all functionality
- Manual and automated test checklists
- Platform-specific tests (iOS/Android)
- Performance and security tests
- Integration test scenarios
- Known limitations

#### c. Updated `docs/navigation-map.md`
- Added `/sign-confirmation` route to the route inventory
- Updated navigation tree ASCII diagram
- Updated route table with new entry points

### 4. Test Suite
**File**: `__tests__/screens/sign-confirmation.test.tsx`

Comprehensive unit tests covering:
- Rendering of all UI elements
- Contact resolution logic
- Validation of required parameters
- Navigation behavior
- Cancellation flow
- Edge cases (empty memo, long text, zero amount)
- Disabled states during processing
- Accessibility
- Theme integration

## Technical Details

### Route Parameters
The screen accepts these parameters:
```typescript
{
  source: string;          // Sender's public key
  destination: string;     // Recipient's public key
  amount: string;          // Payment amount
  assetCode: string;       // Asset code (e.g., "XLM")
  memo?: string;           // Optional memo text
  fee?: string;            // Network fee in stroops
  network?: string;        // Network name (e.g., "Testnet")
}
```

### Dependencies
- **Expo Router**: Navigation and routing
- **useTheme**: Theme colors (light/dark mode)
- **useAppStore**: Access to saved contacts
- **truncateAddress**: Address formatting utility
- **resolveAddressLabel**: Contact name resolution
- **formatAmount**: Currency formatting
- **Button**: Reusable button component
- **ScreenHeader**: Standard header component

## Security Considerations

### What Users See
✅ Transaction amount and recipient  
✅ Network fee and network name  
✅ Memo text (if provided)  
✅ Contact labels (if saved)  
✅ Truncated addresses for privacy  

### What Users Don't See
❌ Transaction XDR envelope  
❌ Sequence numbers  
❌ Raw transaction internals  
❌ Private key (never accessed by this screen)  

### Private Key Protection
- Sign-confirmation screen **never accesses** the private key
- Private key retrieval happens only in review-transaction screen
- Retrieved on-demand from SecureStore during signing phase
- No secret key data in route parameters

---

## User Experience Flow

### Happy Path
1. User enters payment details on Send screen
2. Taps "Send Payment" button
3. **Sign Confirmation screen loads** ← NEW STEP
   - Reviews transaction summary
   - Reads security information
   - Confirms intent to sign
4. Taps "Sign Transaction" button
5. Review Transaction screen loads (existing)
   - Performs cryptographic signing
   - Submits to Stellar network
   - Shows progress phases
6. Payment Success screen loads (existing)
   - Displays transaction hash
   - Shows confirmation receipt

### Cancellation Flow
**Option 1: Cancel from Sign Confirmation**
1. User taps "Cancel" button
2. Confirmation alert appears
3. User confirms cancellation
4. Navigates to home screen (clears flow)

**Option 2: Cancel from Review Transaction**
1. User proceeds past sign confirmation
2. Taps "Cancel" during signing phases
3. Warning displayed
4. Navigates back to home

## Compatibility

### Maintains Existing Architecture
- ✅ Does NOT modify LocalSigner
- ✅ Does NOT modify useSignerHandoff
- ✅ Does NOT change review-transaction logic
- ✅ Does NOT affect 8-phase state machine
- ✅ Compatible with future external signers

### Backward Compatibility
- Review-transaction can still be accessed directly (for other flows)
- Existing SigningConfirmModal preserved (though now bypassed in normal flow)
- All existing tests continue to pass

---

2. `docs/signing-confirmation-flow.md` - Architecture documentation
3. `docs/testing/sign-confirmation-test-plan.md` - Test plan
4. `__tests__/screens/sign-confirmation.test.tsx` - Unit tests

### Existing Files Modified
1. `app/send.tsx` - Updated navigation to include sign-confirmation step
2. `docs/navigation-map.md` - Updated route inventory and navigation tree

### Files Not Modified (Intentionally)

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test full payment flow on iOS device
- [ ] Test full payment flow on Android device
- [ ] Test cancellation from sign confirmation
- [ ] Test with saved contacts
- [ ] Test with unknown addresses
- [ ] Test with empty memo
- [ ] Test with long memo (28 chars)
- [ ] Test in light theme
- [ ] Test in dark theme
- [ ] Test with VoiceOver (iOS)
- [ ] Test with TalkBack (Android)

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run the test suite
npm test sign-confirmation.test.tsx

# Or with coverage
npm test -- --coverage sign-confirmation.test.tsx
```

### Integration Testing
Test the complete flow:
1. Create payment on Send screen
2. Verify sign confirmation loads with correct data
3. Confirm and proceed to signing
4. Verify successful submission
5. Verify payment success screen

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Fee is hardcoded**: Currently set to "100 stroops" (base fee). Real-time fee fetching not implemented yet.
   - **Future enhancement**: Fetch from `server.fetchBaseFee()` before navigation

2. **XLM only**: Only supports native XLM asset.
   - **Future enhancement**: Add multi-asset support with asset issuer display

3. **No transaction simulation**: Cannot preview effects before signing.
   - **Future enhancement**: Integrate Horizon's transaction simulation API

4. **Single signer type**: Shows "This Device" only.
   - **Future enhancement**: Display external/hardware signer info when available

---

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Real-Time Fee Fetching
```typescript
const fee = await server.fetchBaseFee();
router.push({
  pathname: '/sign-confirmation',
  params: { ...otherParams, fee: fee.toString() },
});
```

### 2. Multi-Asset Support
```typescript
params: {
  assetCode: 'USDC',
  assetIssuer: 'GA5ZSEJYB37...',
  assetImage: 'https://...',
}
```

### 3. Transaction Simulation
Add a "Preview Effects" button that shows:
- Account balance changes
- Trustline modifications
- Claimable balance creations

### 4. QR Payment Request Integration
Pre-fill sign confirmation from scanned QR codes:
```typescript
const paymentRequest = parseQRPaymentRequest(qrData);
router.push({
  pathname: '/sign-confirmation',
  params: paymentRequest,
});
```

### 5. External Signer Support
When external wallets are integrated:
- Show external signer name and icon
- Display security model of external signer
- Adapt "Sign Transaction" button text
