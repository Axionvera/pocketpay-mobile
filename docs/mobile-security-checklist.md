# Mobile Security Review Checklist

This checklist should be reviewed by contributors when making changes that affect security-sensitive parts of the PocketPay mobile app.

## Overview

This checklist provides a comprehensive security review guide for mobile changes involving wallets, transactions, vaults, diagnostics, and storage. Use this checklist during PR reviews to ensure security-sensitive changes are properly vetted.

## Purpose

Mobile applications handle sensitive financial data, private keys, and transaction details. This checklist helps reviewers identify and prevent common security vulnerabilities in mobile code.
