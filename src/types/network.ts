/**
 * Network state model for PocketPay mobile.
 *
 * Distinguishes between five connectivity states so the UI can render

 * cached data when the network is unavailable.
 *
 * State hierarchy (best → worst):
 *   online → degraded → service-unavailable → offline → unknown
 */

/**
 * The high-level network connectivity state.
 *
 * - `online`:              Device has internet and Stellar Horizon is reachable.
 * - `degraded`:            Device has internet but Horizon responses are slow or
 *                          intermittent. Read-only cached data is safe to show;
 *                          write-actions should warn the user.
 * - `service-unavailable`: Stellar Horizon or Friendbot is returning server errors
 *                          (5xx, rate-limit). The device itself has connectivity.
 * - `offline`:             Device has no internet connectivity at all.
 * - `unknown`:             Connectivity has not been checked yet (e.g. app boot).
